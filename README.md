# ITC-Pageant-Management-System

This project is specifically designed for a pageant management system tailored for school events. It has been created and modified to support beauty pageants and any type of competition that requires the presence of judges and a structured scoring system. The scores or the evaluations given by the judges are systematically recorded, calculated, and displayed in real-time or after the event, depending on the settings chosen. The system ensures accuracy, transparency, and fairness in the judging process, minimizing human error and bias. It also allows for easy customization of judging criteria, number of rounds, and scoring weightages, making it highly flexible for various types of contests such as talent shows, academic competitions, fashion shows, and more. Administrators can manage participants, assign judges, view analytics, and generate final results and reports seamlessly. Overall, this system streamlines the entire competition process, making it efficient, organized, and user-friendly for schools hosting such events.
